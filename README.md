# Indonesian-Fellowship-Web-App
A web app I made for the 'Indonesian Fellowship' Indonesian community of Pensacola Christian College. <br>
Created with ExpressJS and NodeJS <br>

<h2><strong> Background </strong></h2>
Indonesian Fellowship is a community of Indonesian students studying in Pensacola Christian College.<br>
We regularly do a little fellowship once a week and people are welcome to sign up for any service that they want.<br>
We used to do sign-ups using Google Forms and only the admins would know who signed up for what service. So I thought that it would be better if we made our own registration form and have our own database. <br>

<h2>How it works</h2>
I made this website so that we have our own portal where users can register for an account and log in to sign up for services. They can then keep track of what services they signed up for and would be able to see all the services and all the users who sign up for a service.

<h2> Whats next </h2>
Might be adding other sections for galleries, devotional notes, etc.<br><br>
